## Key Features

The noBIM tool is a python-based tool that allows for the manipulation of Revit and IFC project data in a simple and user-friendly way. It allows you to read and extract data from Revit and IFC files, and then use the Pandas library to process and analyze the data.

With noBIM, you can extract data such as element IDs, coordinates, and material information from the project file, and then use Pandas to create dataframes and perform operations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating the data. Once the data is cleaned and organized, you can use the python visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create graphics such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.

Additionally, noBIM can export the data to other file formats such as CSV, Excel, or JSON, that can be easily imported into other data visualization software or even web applications.

It's important to note that while this method does not require the use of API or plugins, and doesn't need to use any BIM software, it may require some knowledge of python and data analysis skills.

## How To Use

In order to run any code written in Python from this repository, you will need to have Python and any necessary dependencies installed on your computer.

1.  First, make sure you have Python installed by running the command `python --version` in your terminal. If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
    
2.  Next, navigate to the directory where the code is located on your computer using the command `cd path/to/code`.
    
3.  Once you are in the correct directory, you can run the code by typing `python filename.py` (replace "filename" with the actual name of the Python file you wish to run).

Note: Depending on the code, you may need to provide additional input or arguments in order for it to run correctly. Please refer to the comments and documentation within the code for more information.
